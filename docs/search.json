    "text": "I enjoy solving puzzles and playing Sudoku. I love learning languages, and I’m currently studying Spanish. I’m happiest outdoors—hiking, camping, and spending time in nature always refreshes me. I also love traveling and exploring new places, and one of my long-term goals is to visit all the national parks in the U.S. Outside of nature, my favorite places are bookstores and libraries. I love reading books, and I’m an animal person at heart—ducks are my favorite (though I generally adore all birds)."
